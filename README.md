# BuffHook - **REQUIRES GETSPELLINFOVANILLA**
World of Warcraft 1.12.1 Vanilla Addon which shows enemy buffs by hooking WoW API's UnitBuff(unitID, index) and adding buffs to it.

Please do not use this yet. While it may work well in PvP (short fights), it is still unfinished.
Buffs aren't removed properly (always) yet and information isn't added properly at all times yet. Basically data structure is still a bit unpolished.

However, this is what it can look like together with EnemyBuffTimersVanilla:
